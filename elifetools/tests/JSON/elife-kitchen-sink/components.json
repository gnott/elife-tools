        "content": "Bacterially-produced small molecules exert profound influences on animal health,\n                    morphogenesis, and evolution through poorly understood mechanisms. In one of the\n                    closest living relatives of animals, the choanoflagellate Salpingoeca\n                        rosetta, we find that colony development is induced by the prey\n                    bacterium Algoriphagus machipongonensis and its close relatives\n                    in the Bacteroidetes phylum. Here we show that a rosette inducing factor (RIF-1)\n                    produced by A. machipongonensis belongs to the small class of\n                    sulfonolipids, obscure relatives of the better known sphingolipids that play\n                    important roles in signal transmission in plants, animals and fungi. RIF-1 has\n                    extraordinary potency (femtomolar, or 10-15M) and S.\n                        rosetta can respond to it over a broad dynamic range - nine orders\n                    of magnitude. This study provides a prototypical example of bacterial\n                    sulfonolipids triggering eukaryotic morphogenesis and suggests molecular\n                    mechanisms through which bacteria may have contributed to the evolution of\n                    animals.

        "content": "Humans and other animals evolved in a world filled with bacteria, and bacteria\n                    have influenced the evolution of animals and humans. Although bacteria are most\n                    familiar as pathogens, they also produce small molecules that animals and other\n                    eukaryotes need, although the details of these beneficial effects are not well\n                    understood. The choanoflagellates are water-dwelling organisms that use their whip-like\n                    flagella to move around, feeding on bacteria. They can exist as one cell or a\n                    colony of multiple cells and, perhaps surprisingly, are the closest known living\n                    relatives of animals. This means that experiments on these organisms have the\n                    potential to improve our understanding of animal development and the transition\n                    from egg to embryo to adult. Alegado et al. have explored how the morphology of\n                        Salpingoeca rosetta, a colony-forming choanoflagellate, is\n                    influenced by its interactions with various species of bacteria. In particular,\n                    they find that the development of multicellularity in S.\n                        rosettais triggered by the presence of the bacterium\n                        Algoriphagus machipongonensis as well as its close\n                    relatives. They also identify the signaling molecule produced by the bacteria to\n                    be C32H64NO7S; this lipid molecule is an\n                    obscure relative of the sphingolipid molecules that have important roles in\n                    signal transmission in animals, plants, and fungi. Moreover, Alegado et\n                        al. show that S. rosetta can respond to this\n                    molecule - which they call rosette-inducing factor (RIF-1) - over a wide range\n                    of concentrations, including concentrations as low as 10-17M. The work of Alegado et al. suggests that interactions between\n                        S. rosetta and Algoriphagus bacteria could\n                    be a productive model system for studying the influences of bacteria on animal\n                    cell biology and for investigating the mechanisms of signal delivery and\n                    reception. Moreover, the molecular mechanisms revealed by this work leave open\n                    the possibility that bacteria might have contributed to the evolution of\n                    multicellularity in animals. \nDOI:\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00013.002\n",

        "content": "eLife posts the editorial decision letter and author response on a selection of\n                    the published articles (subject to the approval of the authors). An edited\n                    version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating\n                    the substantive concerns or comments; minor concerns are not usually shown.\n                    Reviewers have the opportunity to discuss the decision before the letter is sent\n                    (see review\n                        process). Similarly, the author response typically shows only\n                    responses to the major concerns raised by the reviewers. This paper reports that a bacterial sulfonolipid is able to induce colony development\n                in a choanoflagellate. The active compound, which is produced by the bacterium in\n                tiny amounts, turns out to be active in femtomolar concentrations. Its structure\n                (but not its stereochemistry) is determined on the basis of extensive mass\n                spectrometric and NMR analysis. This is a beautiful piece of work, demonstrating\n                that this sulfonolipid produced by bacteria upon which the choanoflagellate feeds\n                has a profound influence on the predator's development. Specifically, a particular choanoflagellate species will form rosettes, i.e., become\n                multicellular, when certain species of Bacteroidetes are present Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1. The\n                researchers went on to purify and characterize the bacterial molecule responsible\n                for this behavior in the protist. The findings should be of broad interest to the\n                community of biologists, as it includes elements of microbiology, signaling between\n                bacterial and eukaryotic cells that is based on molecules not before known to carry\n                out this function, and the evolution of multicellularity in the sister group to the\n                animals, the choanoflagellates. The work represents a major contribution to concepts\n                about the mechanisms that may have been in play when the evolutionary step to\n                multicellularity took place \u223c a billion years ago.The paper has implications\n                regarding the development of eukaryotic multicellularity. The signal, a bacterial\n                sulfonolipid, is active at remarkably low concentrations.The fmolar activity of the\n                signal seems extraordinary. Could the authors comment in the manuscript how this\n                compares to other ultrasensitive receptors. Are there any described receptors that\n                are more sensitive?The potency of the pure compound compared to the crude extracts\n                is low. This received comment in the manuscript. The authors conclude that it is how\n                the signal is delivered-as a pure relatively hydrophobic compound vs in the context\n                of the bacterial membrane (Table 1 and\n                    2). This is one possibility. It could\n                also be that there is a second signal required for full potency- one that is\n                inactive in the absence of sulfonolipid. We don't know yet about the receptors.\n                Did the authors try any kind of reconstitution experiments that might speak to the\n                hypothesis that potency of sulfonolipids is dependent on the context of delivery?\n                One shortcoming in this work, from an organic chemist's point of view, is that\n                the three-dimensional structure of the signalling molecule has not been defined.\n                With four asymmetric centers in the structure, that means that the active molecule\n                is one of sixteen stereochemical possibilities. So, there is more to be done, and if\n                this research group does not do it quickly, some other organic chemical research\n                group will certainly do it for them!",

        "content": "We are grateful to the reviewers and editors for their thorough consideration of our\n                manuscript and constructive recommendations for revision. In response to comments\n                made in the general assessment of the manuscript, our revisions include: \n1) Discussion of other signaling systems with ultrasensitive receptors (p.\n                    8). Namely, we draw the attention of readers to the well-described silkworm moth\n                    sex pheromone signaling system (see Figure\n                        1), in which 4 fM bombykol (the silkworm moth sex pheromone; refs.\n                    37- 39) is sufficient to induce a behavioral response in males. The potency of\n                    bombykol is comparable to that of RIF-1, which is active at concentrations\n                    ranging from 10-2 fM to 107 fM (Table\n                    1). \n2) An expanded discussion of the difference in activity between purified\n                    RIF-1 vs. the sphingolipid-enriched fraction (Table 2). On p. 8, paragraph 1, we clarify that the difference in\n                    activity could be due either to delivery issues (i.e. a requirement for RIF-1 to\n                    be delivered in the context of the bacterial membrane) or to the absence of\n                    other currently unidentified A. machipongonensis molecules that either amplify\n                    RIF-1 signaling or might independently induce colony development in S. rosetta\n                        (Author response image 1). In\n                    addition, on p. 9 we state that \u201cWe hypothesize that RIF-1 may be\n                    released into the environment in membrane vesicles, which have been described in\n                    Gram-negative bacteria and Bacteroidetes (50,51) and that additional membrane\n                    constituents might be required for the full potency of RIF-1.\u201d\n                    \n10.7554/eLife.00013.039\nAuthor response image 1\n\nCorrelation between mean Voxel Number and resulting mean Decoding\n                            Accuracy (shown for each ROI (N=13) and each of the three pair-wise\n                            comparisons for the Plan-Epoch).\nPearson correlation between Voxel Number and Hand Plan Epoch decoding\n                            accuracies (red diamond symbols): r2=0.108,\n                            p=0.272; Pearson Correlation between Voxel Number and Tool Plan\n                            Epoch decoding accuracies (blue square symbols):\n                            r2=0.025, p=0.602; Pearson Correlation between\n                            Voxel Number and Across-Effector Plan Epoch decoding accuracies (purple\n                            triangle symbols): r2=0.026, p=0.598.\n\nDOI:\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00013.038\n\n\n\n\n Pearson correlation between Voxel Number and Hand Plan Epoch decoding\n                            accuracies (red diamond symbols): r2=0.108,\n                            p=0.272; Pearson Correlation between Voxel Number and Tool Plan\n                            Epoch decoding accuracies (blue square symbols):\n                            r2=0.025, p=0.602; Pearson Correlation between\n                            Voxel Number and Across-Effector Plan Epoch decoding accuracies (purple\n                            triangle symbols): r2=0.026, p=0.598. \nDOI:\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00013.038\n \n3) A more detailed discussion of future directions for this research,\n                    including (as pointed out by the reviewers) the need to determine the\n                    three-dimensional structure of RIF-1 (p. 9, Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1).
